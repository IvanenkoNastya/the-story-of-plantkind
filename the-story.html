        <h2>The story of Plantkind in twelve tenses, sentences, scents and senses</h2>

        <p>
            There is a magical world of pure nature where plantkind does not know a thing about mankind and where trees
            call themselves employers, because they often tend to aid mushrooms and moss, herbs and shrubs, climbers and
            creepers, succulents and ferns... However, unemployment will have been growing for years by the time it dies
            out or all deserted plants become extinct. Owing to employers who will facilitate plants’ lives, this world
            of nature will ever get chance to break through this harsh and dehydrating reality.
        </p>
        <p>
            Majority of trees had been evolving for years before they became noticeable and could employ rare species
            and as much self-sacrificing personalities as possible. Then they were usually striving to enhance
            performance and become essential part of the ecosystem. However, this strategy is missing out something more
            than just expenses and income, it is not solving any global issue.
        </p>
        <p>
            One young Silver Maple tree has done some significant steps towards creating polite and meaningful ecosystem
            in their world, for example it has already reduced red tape in its realm. The tree first discovered
            something about connection between its mood and all souls nearby the day Silver Maple became conscious.
            Plants and mushrooms will be drowning in the masses of available information on the Net when they try to
            meet needs and requirements of their metabolism. The green plantkind has been using the world wide web for
            over 30 years now, so in theory there is all that any specie needs to become an employee sooner or later.
            Maple had launched some startups just in order to employ those who asked for more computing power after the
            Silver tree finally accessed to deep water sources.

            By the time this story of plantkind unemployment ends, the conflicts concerning discrimination of mushrooms
            will have just begun.
