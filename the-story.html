        <h2>The story of Plantkind in twelve tenses, sentences, scents and senses</h2>
        <p>
            There is a magical world of pure nature where plantkind does not know a thing about mankind and where trees
            call themselves employers, because they often tend to aid mushrooms and moss, herbs and shrubs, climbers and
            creepers, succulents and ferns... However, unemployment will have been growing for years by the time it dies
            out or all deserted unemployed plants become extinct. Owing to employers who will facilitate plantsâ€™ lives,
            this world of nature will get chance to break through this harsh and dehydrating reality one day.
        </p>
        <p>
            Majority of trees had been evolving for years before they became noticeable and could employ rare species
            and as many self-sacrificing personalities as possible. Then they were usually striving to enhance
            performance and become an essential part of the ecosystem. However, this strategy is missing out on
            something more than just expenses and income, it is not solving any global issue.

            One young Silver Maple tree has done some significant steps towards creating a polite and meaningful
            ecosystem in their world, for example, the tree has already reduced the red tape in its realm. The tree
            first discovered something about a connection between its mood and all souls nearby the day Silver Maple
            became conscious. Plants and mushrooms will be drowning in the masses of available information on the Net
            when they try to meet the needs and requirements of their metabolism. The green plantkind has been using the
            world wide web for over 30 years now, so in theory there is everything that any specie needs to become an
            employee sooner or later.
            After the Silver tree finally accessed to deep water sources, Maple had launched some startups just in order
            to provide additional computing power to thirsty deserted plants.

        <p>
            By the time this story of plantkind unemployment ends, the conflicts concerning discrimination of mushrooms
            will have only begun.
